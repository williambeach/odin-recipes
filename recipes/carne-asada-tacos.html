<h2>To Get Started, You Need Two Things:</h2>
<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1.5 pounds boneless beef top sirloin, cut into thin bite-size slices</li>
    <li>0.5 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 tsp ground black pepper (fresh is best)</li>
    <li>crushed red pepper for taste</li>
    <li>1 lime</li>
    <li>1 can tomatillos</li>
    <li>2 jalapenos</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>1 can beef broth</li>
    <li>12 corn tortillas (6 inches)</li>
    <li>1/2 large onion (chopped)</li>
    <li>2 tomatoes (chopped)</li>
    <li>1 avocado sliced</li>
    <li>1 bunch of cilantro</li>
    <li>1 lemon</li>
</ul>
<h3>A Creative Touch:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Place sliced meat into a shallow bowl, and season with salt, black pepper, 
        and crushed red pepper. Squeeze the lime juice over the meat, and turn until evenly coated. 
        Cover, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a blender or food processor, combine tomatillo and jalapeno. Puree for 15 to 20 
        seconds, or until thick. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. 
        Carefully pour in tomatillo mixture. Cook, stirring frequently, for 5 minutes. 
        Stir in beef broth. Reduce heat, and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until mixture coats 
        a spoon. Transfer mixture to a serving dish.</li>
    <li>Heat tablespoon oil in a large skillet over high heat. Stir in 1/3 of the beef, and saute 
        for 1 minute. Transfer to serving dish. Repeat with remaining beef. Meanwhile, heat 
        tortillas in the oven or microwave, according to package instructions.</li>
    <li>To serve, place two tortillas on top of each other. Add desired amount of meat, 
        spoon over some tomatillo mixture. Top with onions, tomatoes, avocado and cilantro. 
        Garnish with a wedge of lemon, to be squeezed over taco before eating.</li>
</ol>
